B.tech Project in Prediction of Lung cancer using gene selection and KL divergence

## Abstract

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The early detection of lung cancer is very important to improve the survival rate of patients. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the early detection of lung cancer using gene selection and KL divergence. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we select the genes that are highly correlated with lung cancer. Second, we calculate the KL divergence between the normal and cancerous samples. Third, we select the genes that have a high KL divergence value. We applied the proposed method to the lung cancer dataset and compared the results with those of the existing methods. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
